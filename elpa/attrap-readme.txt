Attrap! provides a command to attempt to fix the flycheck error at point.

Users: Invoke the command `attrap-attrap' when point is on a
flycheck error, and check the results.  (If several fixes apply you
will be asked which one to apply.) Attrap! currently comes with
builtin fixers for `haskell-dante' and `emacs-lisp'.

Configuration: attrap-fixers is an alist from flycheck checker
symbol to attrap fixer.  All the See below for the definition of a fixer.

A fixer is a element is a side-effect-free function mapping an
error message MSG to a list of options.  An option is a cons of a
description and a repair.  (Thus a list of options is an alist.)
The repair is a function of no argument which is meant to apply one
fix suggested by MSG in the current buffer, at point.  The
description is meant to be a summarized user-facing s-expr which
describes the repair.  This description can be used for example for
selecting the best repair.  An option can be conveniently defined
using `attrap-option'.  A singleton option list can be conveniently
defined using `attrap-one-option'.
