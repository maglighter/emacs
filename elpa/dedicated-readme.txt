This minor mode allows you to toggle a window's "dedicated" flag.
When a window is "dedicated", Emacs will not select files into that
window. This can be quite handy since many commands will use
another window to show results (e.g., compilation mode, starting
info, etc.) A dedicated window won't be used for such a purpose.

Dedicated buffers will have "D" shown in the mode line.
