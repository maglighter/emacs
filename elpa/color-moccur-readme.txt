If this program doesn't run, I might change the program for the
worse.  So please send mail to akihisa@mail.ne.jp .
This elisp is the extention of moccur.el.
Thanks to the authors for writing moccur.el
With color-moccur, you can search a regexp in all buffers. And you
can search files like grep(-find) without grep (and find) command.
