<youssef> Hello max
<max> hi!  [21:03]
ERC> /nick fleshlight
*** Your new nickname is fleshlight
<youssef> welcome fleshlight
<youssef> scorpio, xavier I have invited fleshlight who is interrested in
	  programming  [21:04]
<fleshlight> thanks:)
<fleshlight> yes, hi to all
<youssef> let me introduce you the other people
<youssef> xavier and slowbrain are the founder of the project. xavier is or
	  retired lead programmer and manager of the project  [21:05]
<xavier> Hi fleshlight 
<xavier> nice nickname :')
<fleshlight> hi xavier
<youssef> now, scorpio, cfdev and joshua are contributing to the code
<fleshlight> i know  [21:06]
<youssef> we have also packagers, symbol drawers and other contributors in
	  this channel
<xavier> and I am running for my freedom
<xavier> having let a pile of code that need some love...
<xavier> needs*
<xavier> That's C++/Qt4; many things can be rewritten and refactored freely
	 since I will not be there anymore to justify why this or that was
	 made this way  [21:07]
<xavier> Oh, also, there are still many French comments, so the game is kinda
	 "gotta translate em all" ...  [21:08]
<fleshlight> hah  [21:09]
<fleshlight> http://svnweb.tuxfamily.org/listing.php?repname=qet/qet
<fleshlight> is this your svn repository?
<xavier> Still, most contributors, especially those around, speak French
	 natively, so they can help
<xavier> yep
* youssef is going to eat and will be back later  [21:10]
<scorpio810> hi fleshlight
<fleshlight> hi scorpio810 
<fleshlight> so, from where i can start?  [21:11]
<cfdev> hi everybody :)
<cfdev> oua english speak  [21:12]
<fleshlight> hi
<xavier> I guess diving a bit in the code (start with main.cpp, QETApp,
	 QET{Diagram,Element}Editor, etc.) would help you getting an idea of
	 the current shape of QET; also, trying the software itself, may help
								        [21:13]
<cfdev> <fleshlight> so, from where i can start? : scorpio810 ?
<xavier> next, scorpio810, cfdev and joshua recently started working on new
	 features
<xavier> (right after my departure announce)
<xavier> so they may explain what they are trying to achieve  [21:14]
<xavier> Most exchanges related to the development occur here, btw  [21:15]
<xavier> the forum just gathers news and some end-users questions, the mailing
	 list is mainly used to remain informed of commits  [21:16]
<scorpio810> <cfdev> <fleshlight> so, from where i can start? : scorpio810 ? i
	     dont know easy, difficult ?  [21:28]
<fleshlight> now i will try to understand program code  [21:31]
<scorpio810> ok :)  [21:33]
<xavier> fleshlight: by the way, what language / toolkits / frameworks / libs
	 do you usually work with?  [21:43]
<fleshlight> c++, perl, a bit java, now i learn opengl for my diploma  [21:46]
<xavier> Nice
<xavier> Any former experience with Qt?
<fleshlight> no
<xavier> Don't worry, once you know C++, it's a very pleasant toolkit  [21:48]
<xavier> (though some parts are not as polished/maintained as we would need)
<fleshlight> and what libs do you use except Qt?  [21:50]
<xavier> Currently: zero.
<xavier> It's pure Qt
<xavier> Well, scorpio810 and cfdev bolted some kind of external rich text
	 editor into QET recently
<xavier> but it is Qt-based too.

<xavier> fleshlight: do your studies involve producing electric diagrams?
								        [21:53]
<fleshlight> we had course, that included it, we worked in program workbench
								        [21:56]
<xavier> ok
<xavier> that was the main issue with me... no use of what I was
	 programming...
<fleshlight> Electronics WorkBench :)  [21:57]
